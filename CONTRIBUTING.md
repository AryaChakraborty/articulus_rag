## Issue Tracking

We use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/AryaChakraborty/articulus_rag/issues) to track all tasks related to this project.

## Build the project locally

In order to contribute to a project on GitHub, you must first get a copy of the project running locally on your computer. This process is sometimes called a "build process", and every project's process will have different requirements. Some requirements are due to the project being hosted on GitHub, some are due to the programming language used, some are due to the project's dependencies.

There are five steps to building this project:

1. [Set up Git and Install dependency](#set-up-git-and-install-nodejs)
1. [Fork the repository](#fork-the-repository)
1. [Clone your fork](#clone-your-fork)
1. [Install dependencies](#install-dependencies)
1. [Run the project](#run-the-project)


### Set up Git and Install dependency

https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/set-up-git

### Fork the repository

A *fork* is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository lets you to make changes to your copy without affecting any of the original code.

Click **Fork** (in the top-right corner of the page) to copy this repository to your GitHub account.

### Clone your fork

Cloning our fork lets you download a copy of the repository to your computer.

Use `git` to clone your fork

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/articulus_rag
```

### Install dependencies

First, navigate into the project's directory

```
$ cd articulus_rag
```

Next, use `pip` to install the project' dependencies
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Developers Note :** Install the source code as a package in editable format
```
$ pip install -e .
```

### Run the project

```
$ python app.py
```

### Run the streamlit app
```
streamlit run <path-to-the-streamlit-app>
```

## Submit a Pull Request
 A *pull request* is a GitHub feature that lets you do just that!

There are three steps to submitting a pull request:
1. [Save your changes locally](#save-your-changes-locally)
2. [Send your changes to your fork](#send-your-changes-to-your-fork)
3. [Open a Pull Request](#open-a-pull-request)

These instructions are designed to explain the bare minimum steps in a beginner-friendly way.

### Save your changes locally

First, get a list of all the files you have changed.
```
$ git status
```

Next, *stage* the file you want to save. This will add the file to a new list that is ready to be saved.
```
$ git add .
```

Next, verify that the file has been staged correctly. Notice that the text color has changed, and your file is now in a list that says "Changes to be committed" instead of "Changes not staged for commit"
```
$ git status
```

Finally, save your staged files.
```
$ git commit -m "commit_message"
```

You'll often hear this process called *committing* changes. It's the exact same thing.

### Send your changes to your fork

With one simple `git` command, you can send the changes you just committed locally to your *fork* on GitHub.

```
$ git push origin master
```

### Alternatively, contribute using GitHub Desktop

1. **Open GitHub Desktop:**
   Launch GitHub Desktop and log in to your GitHub account if you haven't already.

2. **Clone the Repository:**
   - If you haven't cloned the articulus_rag repository yet, you can do so by clicking on the "File" menu and selecting "Clone Repository."
   - Choose the articulus_rag repository from the list of repositories on GitHub and clone it to your local machine.

3. **Switch to the Correct Branch:**
   - Ensure you are on the branch that you want to submit a pull request for.
   - If you need to switch branches, you can do so by clicking on the "Current Branch" dropdown menu and selecting the desired branch.

4. **Make Changes:**
   Make your changes to the code or files in the repository using your preferred code editor.

5. **Commit Changes:**
   - In GitHub Desktop, you'll see a list of the files you've changed. Check the box next to each file you want to include in the commit.
   - Enter a summary and description for your changes in the "Summary" and "Description" fields, respectively. Click the "Commit to <branch-name>" button to commit your changes to the local branch.

6. **Push Changes to GitHub:**
   After committing your changes, click the "Push origin" button in the top right corner of GitHub Desktop to push your changes to your forked repository on GitHub.

7. **Create a Pull Request:**
  - Go to the GitHub website and navigate to your fork of the articulus_rag repository.
  - You should see a button to "Compare & pull request" between your fork and the original repository. Click on it.

8. **Review and Submit:**
   - On the pull request page, review your changes and add any additional information, such as a title and description, that you want to include with your pull request.
   - Once you're satisfied, click the "Create pull request" button to submit your pull request.

### Open a Pull Request

1. Find the [New Pull Request](https://github.com/AryaChakraborty/articulus_rag/compare/) button
2. Select the option to **compare across forks**
3. Select **your username** in the `head fork` option
4. Select **your username** in the `base` option<sup>*</sup>
5. Click **Create Pull Request**

You can refer to the following articles on basics of Git and Github and also contact the Project Mentors, in case you are stuck (using issues or creating a new discussion):


Start working on issue only after you got assigned that issue, and let the code owner put the special tags in case it is an open-source event ðŸš€.
