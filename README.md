<h3>🌍Project Overview</h3>

<p>A platform for empowering transparency in media leverages AI-driven chatbots and content from journalism students to provide credible insights on global affairs, addressing gaps in Indian journalism. Inspired by my struggle to find concise information on India's stance on the Russia-Ukraine conflict during an interview preparation, and concerns about biased media coverage in regions like Manipur and Ladakh, the project aims to promote factual reporting and informed discourse. By offering accurate responses to complex queries and fostering a culture of fact-based reporting, it seeks to mitigate the prevalence of biased or incomplete information in Indian media, promoting transparency, accountability, and knowledge dissemination in the digital age.</p>

<h3>✨ Features</h3>
 - 📰 AI-Driven Chatbots: Get accurate, AI-generated responses to your complex queries.
 - 🎓 Student Contributions: Involve journalism students in content creation for a fresh perspective.
 - 🗺️ Global Insights: Access reliable information on global affairs with ease.
 - 📈 Transparency Promotion: Encourage a culture of factual reporting and reduce biased media coverage.
 - 🔍 Concise Information: Quickly find summarized information on critical issues.
 - 📊 Real-Time Updates: Stay informed with the latest news and insights.
